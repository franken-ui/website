## What is Franken UI

Franken UI is an open-source library of UI components that works as a standalone or as a Tailwind CSS plugin. Under the hood, it uses [UIkit 3](https://getuikit.com) and extended with [LitElement](https://lit.dev). The design is based on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).

While it may appear confusing to beginners at first glance, it is actually straightforward. Let's explore Franken UI in detail:

- **Tailwind CSS** - A utility-first CSS framework that offers classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center`, and `rotate-90`, which can be combined to create any design directly in your markup.
- **UIkit** - A modular front-end framework for developing fast and powerful web interfaces.
- **shadcn/ui** - A collection of re-usable components.

Consider this: using Tailwind CSS alone may lead to cluttered HTML with numerous utility classes, which can be a nightmare to maintain. This is where UIkit shines. It provides pre-built components such as inputs, buttons, accordions, and more, along with a mature JavaScript library for modals, popovers, carousels, toast notifications, and other features. So, what is the role of shadcn/ui? Think of it as a "skin" that has a beautiful, opinionated design. Now, fuse them all together and we have Franken UI.

            While shadcn/ui offers beautifully designed components, it is
            React-first. Franken UI aims to provide a solution for those who are
            not comfortable using or do not want to use React.

          <p>
            No, Tailwind CSS is not required. However, Franken UI also doubles as a
            Tailwind CSS plugin, so you can upgrade to a proper build later if
            you want.
