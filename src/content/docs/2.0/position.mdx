import Snippet from "snippets/component.astro";

## Usage

To apply this component, add one of the `.uk-position-*` classes to a block element. When using this component to place content on top of an image, add the `.uk-inline` class from the [Utility component](utility.md#inline) to a container element around the image and the element to create a position context.

| Class                 | Description                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `.uk-position-top`    | Positions the element at the top.    |
| `.uk-position-left`   | Positions the element at the left.   |
| `.uk-position-right`  | Positions the element at the right.  |
| `.uk-position-bottom` | Positions the element at the bottom. |

```html
<div class="uk-inline">
  <!-- Place any content, like an image, here -->

  <div class="uk-position-center"></div>
</div>
```

<Snippet component="position.basic" />

### X and Y directions

You can also apply more specific positions that won't spread over one side of the parent container by adding one of the following classes.

| Class                        | Description                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.uk-position-top-left`      | Positions the element at the top left.                   |
| `.uk-position-top-center`    | Positions the element at the top center.                 |
| `.uk-position-top-right`     | Positions the element at the top right.                  |
| `.uk-position-center`        | Positions the element vertically centered in the middle. |
| `.uk-position-center-left`   | Positions the element vertically centered on the left.   |
| `.uk-position-center-right`  | Positions the element vertically centered on the right.  |
| `.uk-position-bottom-left`   | Positions the element at the bottom left.                |
| `.uk-position-bottom-center` | Positions the element at the bottom center.              |
| `.uk-position-bottom-right`  | Positions the element at the bottom right.               |

```html
<div class="uk-position-top-right"></div>
```

<Snippet component="position.xy_directions" />

### Center

You can also apply more specific positions that won't spread over one side of the parent container by adding one of the following classes.

| Class                            | Description                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.uk-position-center-horizontal` | Positions the element at the center from top to bottom. |
| `.uk-position-center-vertical`   | Positions the element at the center from left to right. |

```html
<div class="uk-position-center-horizontal"></div>
```

<Snippet component="position.center" />

### Cover

If you want a position element to cover its container, just add the `.uk-position-cover` class.

```html
<div class="uk-position-cover"></div>
```

<Snippet component="position.cover" />

### Outside

There are two classes to center elements outside on the left and right of the parent container. This is useful to position the [Slidenav component](/docs/2.0/slidenav) outside of a [Slideshow](/docs/2.0/slideshow) or [Slider](/docs/2.0/slider) component.

| Class                           | Description                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.uk-position-center-left-out`  | Positions the element vertically centered outside on the left.  |
| `.uk-position-center-right-out` | Positions the element vertically centered outside on the right. |

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> Once the outside positioned
element sticks out of the viewport to the right, it will cause a horizontal
scrollbar. Use the [Visibility component](/docs/2.0/visibility) to hide the outside
positioned element on a smaller viewports and show an inside positioned element
instead.

```html
<div class="uk-position-center-left-out"></div>
```

<Snippet component="position.outside" />

## Small modifier

To apply a small margin to positioned elements, add the `.uk-position-sm` class.

```html
<div class="uk-position-center uk-position-sm"></div>
```

<Snippet component="position.small" />

## Medium modifier

To apply a medium margin to positioned elements, add the `.uk-position-md` class.

```html
<div class="uk-position-center uk-position-md"></div>
```

<Snippet component="position.medium" />

## Large modifier

To apply a large margin to positioned elements, add the `.uk-position-lg` class.

```html
<div class="uk-position-lg uk-position-center"></div>
```

<Snippet component="position.large" />
