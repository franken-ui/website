## Preventing layout shift

When loading Web Components, there may be a brief delay before the content is fully rendered. This can result in a flash of unstyled content or unprocessed templates. To mitigate this issue, consider setting a predefined height on the parent element to prevent layout shift and ensure a smooth user experience.

```html
<div class="size-4">
  <uk-icon icon="smile"></uk-icon>
</div>
```
