## Usage

To apply this component, add the `data-uk-offcanvas` attribute to a parent `<div>` element and use the following classes.

| Class                 | Description                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.uk-offcanvas-bar`   | Add this class to a child `<div>` element.                                                                                                |
| `.uk-offcanvas-close` | Add this class and the `data-uk-close` attribute to an `<a>` or `<button>` element to create a close button and enable its functionality. |

You can use any element to toggle an offcanvas sidebar. To enable the necessary JavaScript, add the `data-uk-toggle` attribute. An `<a>` element needs to be linked to the id of the offcanvas container. If you are using another element, like a button, just add the `data-uk-toggle="target: #ID"` attribute to target the id of the offcanvas container.

```html
<body>
  <!-- This is a button toggling the offcanvas -->
  <button data-uk-toggle="target: #my-id" type="button"></button>

  <!-- This is an anchor toggling the offcanvas -->
  <a href="#my-id" data-uk-toggle></a>

  <!-- This is the offcanvas -->
  <div id="my-id" data-uk-offcanvas>
    <div class="uk-offcanvas-bar">
      <button class="uk-offcanvas-close absolute top-4 right-4" type="button" data-uk-close></button>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

<Snippet component="offcanvas.basic" />

### Overlay

To add an overlay, blanking out the page, add the `overlay: true` parameter to the `data-uk-offcanvas` attribute.

```html
<div id="my-id" data-uk-offcanvas="overlay: true">...</div>
```

<Snippet component="offcanvas.overlay" />

## Flip modifier

Add the `flip: true` parameter to the `data-uk-offcanvas` attribute to adjust its alignment, so that it slides in from the right.

```html
<div id="my-id" data-uk-offcanvas="flip: true">...</div>
```

<Snippet component="offcanvas.flip" />

## Animation modes

By default, the offcanvas slides in. But you can actually choose between different animation modes for the offcanvas's entrance. Just add one of the following attributes.

| Parameter      | Description                                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mode: slide`  | The offcanvas slides out and overlays the content. This is the default mode. |
| `mode: push`   | The offcanvas slides out and pushes the site.                                |
| `mode: reveal` | The offcanvas slides out and reveals its content while pushing the site.     |
| `mode: none`   | The offcanvas appears and overlays the content without an animation.         |

```html
<div id="my-id" data-uk-offcanvas="mode: push">...</div>
```

<Snippet component="offcanvas.animations" />

## Nav in Offcanvas

You can use the [Nav component](/docs/2.0/nav) inside an offcanvas to create a mobile navigation.

```html
<div id="my-id" data-uk-offcanvas>
  <div class="uk-offcanvas-bar">
    <ul class="uk-nav uk-nav-default">
      ...
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
```

<Snippet component="offcanvas.nav" />

## Component options

Any of these options can be applied to the component attribute. Separate multiple options with a semicolon. [Learn more](/docs/2.0/javascript#component-configuration)

| `overlay`   | Boolean | `false` | Display the offcanvas together with an overlay.                                                                                                          |
| `esc-close` | Boolean | `true`  | Close the offcanvas when the _Esc_ key is pressed.                                                                                                       |
| `bg-close`  | Boolean | `true`  | Close the offcanvas when the background is clicked.                                                                                                      |
| `container` | String  | `false` | Define a target container via a selector to specify where the offcanvas should be appended in the DOM. Setting it to `false` will prevent this behavior. |

`mode` is the _Primary_ option and its key may be omitted, if it's the only option in the attribute value.

```html
<span uk-offcanvas="push"></span>
```

## Accessibility

The Offcanvas component adheres to the [Dialog (Modal) WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialogmodal/) and automatically sets the appropriate WAI-ARIA roles, states and properties.

- The _offcanvas bar_ has the `dialog` role, and if the offcanvas has an overlay, the `aria-modal` property.

The Close component automatically sets the appropriate WAI-ARIA roles and properties.

- The _close icon_ has the `aria-label` property, and if an `<a>` element is used, the `button` role.

### Keyboard interaction

The Offcanvas component can be accessed through keyboard using the following keys.

- The <kbd>esc</kbd> key closes the offcanvas. This behaviour is disabled if the `bg-close: false` option is set.
