import Snippet from "snippets/component.astro";

## Usage

To create an element that remains at the top of the viewport when scrolling down the site, add the `data-uk-sticky` attribute to that element.

```html
<div data-uk-sticky></div>
```

<Snippet component="sticky.basic" />

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> Example elements on this
page are only sticky until you scroll down to the next heading and disappear
afterwards. This was done so as not to clutter your screen with all variations
of sticky containers.

## Position

By default, the element sticks to the top of the viewport. You can set the `position: bottom` option to stick it to the bottom of the viewport.

```html
<div data-uk-sticky="position: bottom"></div>
```

<Snippet component="sticky.position" />

## Start

To apply an offset to when the element should start being sticky, add the `start` option. The value can be in vh, % and px. It supports basic mathematics operands + and -. The default value of `0` means that the element's top border and viewport's top border intersect. A CSS Selector will set start to the selected element's bottom border and the element's top border.

```html
<!-- Sticks after 200px scrolling -->
<div data-uk-sticky="start: 200"></div>

<!-- Sticks after scrolling the elements height -->
<div data-uk-sticky="start: 100%"></div>

<!-- Sticks after 20vh scrolling -->
<div data-uk-sticky="start: 20vh"></div>

<!-- Sticks after the top of the selected element -->
<div id="my-id">
  <div data-uk-sticky="start: #my-id"></div>
</div>
```

<Snippet component="sticky.start" />

## End

To apply an offset to when the element should stop being sticky, add the `stop` option. The value can be in vh, % and px. It supports basic mathematics operands + and -. A value of `0` means that the element's top border and viewport's top border intersect, which would cause the element not to be sticky at all if start is also set to `0`. A CSS Selector will set the end to the selected element's bottom border and the element's bottom border. `false` will make the element stick until the end of the page. `true` selects the parent element.

```html
<!-- Sticks until 200px scrolling -->
<div data-uk-sticky="end: 200"></div>

<!-- Sticks until scrolling the elements height -->
<div data-uk-sticky="end: 100%"></div>

<!-- Sticks until 20vh scrolling -->
<div data-uk-sticky="end: 20vh"></div>

<!-- Sticks until the bottom of the selected element -->
<div data-uk-sticky="end: #my-id"></div>
<div id="my-id"></div>

<!-- Sticks until the bottom of its parent container -->
<div>
  <div data-uk-sticky="end: true"></div>
</div>
```

<Snippet component="sticky.end" />

## Offset

To set an offset to the viewport's edge when the element is sticky, add the `offset` option. The value can be in vh, % and px. It supports basic mathematics operands + and -.

```html
<div data-uk-sticky="offset: 200"></div>
```

<Snippet component="sticky.offset" />

## Animation

Add an animation from the [Animation component](/docs/2.0/animation) in order to have the sticky element reappear smoothly if a start offset is set.

```html
<div data-uk-sticky="start: 200; animation: uk-anmt-slide-top"></div>
```

<Snippet component="sticky.animation" />

## Show On Up

You can make the sticky element show only when scrolling up to save space. Together with an animation, this makes for a very smooth experience.

```html
<div data-uk-sticky="show-on-up: true"></div>
```

<Snippet component="sticky.show_on_up" />

## Responsive

It's possible to disable the sticky behavior for different device widths by applying the `media` option to the attribute and adding the appropriate viewport width. Add a number in pixel, for example `media: 640`, or a breakpoint, for example `media: @m`. The element will be sticky from the specified viewport width and upwards, but not below.

```html
<div data-uk-sticky="media: 640"></div>
```

<Snippet component="sticky.responsive" />

## Oversized Content

Sticky content that is larger than the viewport will scroll down and stick to the bottom of the viewport. Changing the scroll direction will immediately scroll the sticky content up and change the sticky behavior to stick to the top of the viewport. Scrolling down will change the behavior again.

<Snippet component="sticky.oversized_content" />

## Overflow Flip

The `overflow-flip` option disables the sticky behavior for oversized content. Instead, it only flips the sticky position if the element is larger than the viewport. Changing the scroll direction will not affect the sticky position. Together with the `start` and `end` options, two nice sticky effects can be achieved. Cover an element by following content or reveal it by previous content.

```html
<!-- Section will be covered by the next section -->
<div data-uk-sticky="overflow-flip: true; end: 100%"></div>

<div>Some section.</div>

<!-- Section will be revealed by the previous section -->
<div
  data-uk-sticky="position: bottom; overflow-flip: true; start: -100%; end: 0"
></div>
```

<Snippet component="sticky.overflow_flip" />

## Component options

Any of these options can be applied to the component attribute. Separate multiple options with a semicolon. [Learn more](/docs/2.0/javascript#component-configuration)

| `target-offset ` | `false`, Length               | `false`     | Initially make sure that the Sticky element is not over a referenced element via the page's location hash.
