import Snippet from "snippets/component.astro";

## Usage

To create a stepper, just add the `.uk-stepper` class to a `<ul>` tag.

```html
<ul class="uk-stepper uk-stepper-default">
  <li>
    <a href="#">Personal Info</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Account Info</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Confirmation</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

<Snippet component="stepper.basic" />

## Active modifier

This example can be used to highlight the current step in the stepper, indicating which step is actively being worked on.

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> When you add the
`.uk-active` class to one of your `li` tags, the previous `li` tags will
automatically change colors.

<Snippet component="stepper.active" />

## Checked modifier

To show a checkmark when the step has been finished, add the `.uk-stepper-checked` to one of your `li` tag.

<Snippet component="stepper.checked" />

## Counter modifier

This example can be used to display step numbers within the stepper, helping to indicate the sequence of steps. Each li tag will be numbered to show its position in the progression.

<Snippet component="stepper.counter" />
